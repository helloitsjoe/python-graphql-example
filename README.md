# Python GraphQL Example

Django/Graphene, based on [howtographql.com's Python course](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-python/1-getting-started/)

### To work in virtual environment
If a `venv` folder exists:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
You'll seee a `(venv)...` on the command line. If no `venv` folder exists, run `python -m venv venv` first.

To leave virtual environment, just run `deactivate`


### To start server

From inside the virtual environment, and inside the `hackernews` directory, run `python manage.py runserver`
